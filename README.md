# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
Make sure npm is installed on your machine and run `npm install` in the package.json root directory

## Primary Libraries

* [Material UI](http://localhost:3000) - For managing look, feel, and page components
* [Formik](https://formik.org/) - For form state management and validation
* [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) - For form state validation (but can be used on any JS object)
* [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) - For language globalization support

## Thoughts In Review

* I wrote no unit tests. I spent too much time on the look and feel.
* I wanted to make the form a SPA, but have the "thank you" page be on a different route. I would have used [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) had I gotten to it.
* I want to extract many of the page sections into their own components for the sake of code clarity/brevity.
